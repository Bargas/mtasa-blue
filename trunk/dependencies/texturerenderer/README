- DESCRIPTION                                                                -
==============================================================================
  This project contains a DirectShow video renderer interface that is
  capable of rendering directly to a Direct3D 9 texture that is heavily based
  on the Texture3D9 sample in the WIndows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK. This
  code fixes some compatibility problems with more common graph setups, such
  as XviD videos. Thus, a DirectShow video graph can be set up that plays back
  a video file and outputs this to an in-game texture of some sort, allowing
  easy in-game video playback.

  An example of usage of this filter involves manually creating the DirectShow
  graph by adding the video renderer renderer as a filter (among other
  filters) and connecting the appropriate pins. The texture renderer should be
  connected to a video output pin.

  Experimenting with DirectShow graphs, and debugging your graph creation code
  can be done easily with the graphedt.exe tool in the Windows Server 2003 R2
  Platform SDK (or higher).

  In order for this project to compile and to be used, you will need the
  Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK, which contains all the necessary
  DirectShow libraries and headers. This project contains code and is based on
  code from the SDK.
  Please copy the /Samples/Multimedia/DirectShow/BaseClasses directory to
  the /directshow directory in this project's root. Any compilation errors can
  be fixed by applying the patch files that are included in the directory.
  
  The precompiled libraries were compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio 2003.
